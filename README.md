Install gulp and Bower

Building the theme requires node.js. We recommend you update to the latest version of npm: npm install -g npm@latest.

From the command line:

Install gulp and Bower globally with npm install -g gulp bower
Navigate to the theme directory, then run npm install
Run bower install
You now have all the necessary dependencies to run the build process.
